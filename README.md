# StateBox-QV11
US States with overlayed boxes with measures

This is something I put together for a client that wanted to visualize two measure on the US states.  
To be honest, a table would have been just as good.  
  
It features automatic collision detection for the boxes to avoid overlap, if anyone wants to speed up the placement algorithm please do :) Use it as is or rip out the code for the map, label/box placement to kickstart your own project.
